1:I feel like I tend to make some really awful variable names from time to time, mostly when I get kind of 
deep into a coding project, which probably makes it quite difficult for people reading my code when they go back through.

2:I found the part about magic strings interesting. It wasn't something I hadn't thought about throughly, but it makes sense.

3:I tend to disagree with the point about not making journal style comments, especially in a context where multiple people
are working on the same program. If there are multiple people on one program, it makes sense to me to have a log of changes that people 
can go back and look at, though I guess that is also accomplished by GitHub.
